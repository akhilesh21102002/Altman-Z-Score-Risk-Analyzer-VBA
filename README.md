# Altman Z-Score Analyzer (Excel VBA)

This Excel VBA tool automates bankruptcy risk assessment using the Altman Z-Score framework. Users can input financial metrics and select the firm type (Manufacturing, Non-Manufacturing, or Private), after which the tool applies the appropriate formula, classifies the company’s risk zone, and displays the results in a structured table.

It also features a dynamic scatter chart to visualize each company’s Z-Score, with options to add multiple companies, run analyses, and clear results. Built entirely in VBA with structured inputs, built-in error handling, and clean visuals.
